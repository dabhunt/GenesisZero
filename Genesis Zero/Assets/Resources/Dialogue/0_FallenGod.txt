BUG-E; Wait, I know you, you're...;2
FALLEN GOD; I am Honos. Before the shutdown I was once considered the A.I. God of Justice.;2
DEX; You don't work for that scum the Terminus Mind, do you? He's the reason my sister is locked up.;2
FALLEN GOD; Not anymore, I'm the first A.I. god who refused the Terminus's command to imprison humans in the name of safety.;2
FALLEN GOD; During the Great Shutdown I was unfortunately believed to be an ally of the Terminus Mind and dismantled. While I still have my powers, I no longer have the means to use them.;2
Dex; So you're a Bot and an enemy of the Terminus Mind? Maybe you can help me after all.;2
Fallen God; If you wish to obtain my powers, you must make a great sacrifice, for only those with the potential to stop the Terminus's reawakening are allowed my Blessings!;2
BUG-E; So what do you want? Something ridiculous like the head of the Snake God Hestia?;2
FALLEN GOD; No, I'm more interested in those modifiers you are carrying around, but I do happen to know where she can be found.;2
FALLEN GOD: Hestia is located in The Depths below the Refinery. Even with my blessings you would be foolish to enter her domain unprepared...;2
Dex; Good to know. Now about those Blessings...;2
