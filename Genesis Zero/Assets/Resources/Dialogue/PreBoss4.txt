Hestia; It seems a human has found a way out of its cage. You even managed to gather some powerful blessings from my fallen brethren. Are they an offering for me? ;-1
Dex;  The days of humanity worshipping you are over. ;5
Hestia; Clearly you underestimate me. You have brought these blessings to my domain, and I will take them from your dead hands if I have to! ;6
