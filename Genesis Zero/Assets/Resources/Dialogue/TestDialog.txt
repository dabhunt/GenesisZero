BUG-E: It appears my location has been altered. Am I in the seventh street slums, is that correct?;-1;
ZERO: Well... we just call it seventh street. ;2;
ZERO: ... ;2;
ZERO: What kinda bot are you anyway?;2.5;
BUG-E: I used to work as a Leak Detection bot downtown, before the shutdown. Not sure my job means much now, according to the last timestamp in my memChip I haven't shown up to work in 3 years. ;-1;
BUG-E: Unless they happen to have a very lienient attendance policy...;3;
ZERO: That's cool and all, but I think I'd better get going. ;2;
BUG-E: Wait, before you go, I need to give you something as a thank you for helping fix me;3;
ZERO: Well make it quick, I've got to get to the Refinery befo- ;2;
BUG-E: The Refinery, that's where I used to work! They even built me with this handy Essence detector add on so that I could see where Essence was leaking from in the facility.;-1;
BUG-E: I can show you a shortcut to get there, assuming you don't mind jumping across rooftops.;-1;
ZERO: If you can help me find Essence along the way, I suppose you can come. But I'm not taking you for your sparkling conversation, so you'll need to be quiet.;-1;
BUG-E: Fantastic. I was gonna give one of these to you anyway as a token of my gratitude, but now that we're going to the refinery I know you'll need it.;-1;
