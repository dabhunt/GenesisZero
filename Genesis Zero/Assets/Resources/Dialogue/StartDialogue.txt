BUG-E; Greetings human! It appears my location has been altered while I was powered down. Is this Junkyard-221A?;-1
Dex; We just call it the Dunkirk Junkyard, but yes.;2
Dex; You look like some kind of modded first gen Bot, but you shouldn't be able to talk.;2
BUG-E; I was made to look like the BUG-e delivery drone, but I am way more special! I can talk, and my humor parameters are 2.3x higher.;2
DEX; Well 'BUG-e', I guess I'll have to tell people I'm the reason humor is dead, because I am going to sell you for essence.;2
BUG-E; Wait wait! If essence is what you want, I can provide! I can show you a quick route to a massive storage of essence, it should be located where I once worked.;2
BUG-E; I can also help you collect Essence on our way there as I can detect and extract nearby Essence.;2
Dex; ... ;2
BUG-E; So is it a deal? You don't sell me for spare change and I make you rich with essence?;2
Dex; Fine.;2
BUG-E; Great! To the Dunkirk Refinery we go!;2
