BUG-E; Hey Dex, are you ready for our expedition? ;5
DEX; Just about. ;5
BUG-E; Really? Because according to my analysis you have a 78% chance of perishing at your current equipment level. You'll need a few hardware upgrades in order to safely pass through the refinery and get to the depths. ...and by a few I mean 15. ;5
DEX; It sounds like your Pessimism module is the only thing that needs an upgrade, c'mon we'll be fine. I'll loot some bots on the way. ;5
