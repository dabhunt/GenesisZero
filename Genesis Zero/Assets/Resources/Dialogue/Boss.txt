BUG-E; This is it, the Depths. ;2
Dex; Finally, assuming you were telling the truth about all that essence, I'll finally be able to free my sister.;2
BUG-E; Keep your voice down, we don't want to awaken Hestia now.;2
BUG-E; I do hope you can save your sister from whatever her circumstances are. No one deserves to suffer.;2
Dex; Maybe you aren't as bad a Bot as the others, BUG-E.;2
BUG-E; Well I was created to contain the necessary code to restore the Terminus Mind, so of course I wouldn't be like them!;2
Dex; ...What!;2
BUG-E; Don't worry, I have no intention of restoring the Terminus Mind, I enjoy my freedom.;2
BUG-E; Wait, the ground is ... !;2
*the essence stirs and two glowing eyes appear on the other side of the room*
Hestia; It seems an insect has found its way out of its cage. And it seems it has brought quite the valuable prize along with it.;3
Hestia; Hand over the Restoration Key and I will let you continue living the rest of your meaningless life.;2
Dex; BUG-E, when you said there was a large sum of essence here, did you actually mean what is inside Hestia?;2
BUG-E; Of course, where else would you be able to find more essence then what is inside me?;2
Dex; ...;2
Dex; Fine. Hestia, you're going to help me save my Sister!;2
Hestia; Then you shall bathe in the fire of my Blessings!;2
